# Projects 
## Machine Learning : 
   * [Diabetes Outcome Prediction](https://github.com/aashay15/Diabetes-Outcome-Prediction) : (Binary Classification Problem) Basic Data analysis of diabetes patients and predicting based on the provided features wether a person is detected with diabetes or not.
   * [Housing Prices Prediction](https://github.com/aashay15/Housing-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Housing-Data-Analysis.md) : (Regression Problem) Performed few visualisation methods to understand how house prices are affected and based on visualisation developed some prediction models and compared them for accuracy.
   * [Titanic Data EDA & Prediction Top 4% Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sharmaaashay/titanic-eda-prediction-top-4) : (Classification Problem) The Hello World of Data Science, but here I tried to implement more advanced models like RandomForest and XGBoost.
   * [NLP Capstone Project](https://github.com/aashay15/DS-Capstone) : (NLP Prediction Problem) Predicting the next word based on the user input.

## Exploratory Data Analysis : 
  * [Covid Vaccination Progress worldwide](https://www.kaggle.com/sharmaaashay/vaccine-data-eda) : Visualising the overall progress of covid vaccination worldwide. 
  * [Placements Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/sharmaaashay/placements-eda) : Plotting multiple graphs to see how different parameters affect ones placement outcome.
  * [NLP Capstone Project EDA](https://github.com/aashay15/DS-Capstone/blob/master/Milestone.md) : EDA for my JHU Data Science Specialization (Coursera)

## Deep Learning : 
  * [DCGAN](https://github.com/aashay15/Anime-DCGAN) : A keras implementation of a DCGAN that generates anime character faces. 
  * *Also familiar with practically using tensorflow API for object detection*

## Other Projects : 
  * [Extractive Video & Text Summarizer](https://github.com/aashay15/Extractive-Video-Text-Summarizer) : (Python Project) This project basically takes a video and subtitles file and summarizes the video along with producing a text based summary of the video give in the input.
  * [Poke 3D](https://github.com/aashay15/Poke3D) : (Swift) Basically a AR based project in swift, this project is one of my practice project from the IOS development course on Udemy.

(*This is my intial protfolio, there are few projects which are not added in this as they are under progress will soon update the list as soon as the projects are completed*)
